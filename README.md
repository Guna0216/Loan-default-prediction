The central goal is to engineer an advanced machine learning solution aimed at precisely forecasting the probability of individuals defaulting on loans. This initiative is crucial in the banking sector, where extending loans forms a significant component of their revenue stream. However, this activity inherently carries the risk of borrowers failing to repay their loans, a scenario that poses a substantial threat to the financial health and stability of these institutions. Addressing this challenge through predictive analytics not only safeguards banks against potential financial losses but also streamlines the loan approval process by identifying high-risk applicants. The development of such a predictive model requires careful consideration of various borrower- related factors and the effective handling of complex data characteristics, including multicollinearity and missing values, to ensure accuracy and reliability in default prediction.

- Built and trained each model (AdaBoost, Decision Tree, KNN, LDA, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, QDA, Random Forest) is chosen for its unique approach to classification.
- Models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to identify the most effective model for the problem at hand.
- Upon considering the accuracies and contributions of false positives and false negatives, we can say the random forest performs the best among the all the models. o In Phase 2, our Random Forest classifier was optimized using an Optuna study with the objective to maximize the F1 score. Key hyperparameters were fine-tuned:
  - 'n_estimators' was tested between 10 to 100 to balance performance and computational cost,
  - 'max_depth' was explored on a logarithmic scale from 2 to 32 to control complexity and overfitting,
  - 'min_samples_split' and 'min_samples_leaf' were adjusted within the range of 2 to 14 to prevent overfitting by avoiding too fine-grained patterns. The best hyperparameters from the study were used to train the model, which then predicted test data labels and measured the precision of the model via the F1 score.
  - With the optimal parameters from Optuna study we created a pickle file for random Forest model which is used to classify the loan status in the Flask app.
